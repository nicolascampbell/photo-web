    <p id="first"> Hello! I am Nicolas, and I have a dog! Well my brother has him... and feeds him
        and spends time with him... well.. anyways I brought him home! Here is a random pic 
        of vienna in a random place!
        This is just an improvised paragraph haha.

        The domestic dog's origin includes the dog's genetic divergence from the wolf, 
        its domestication, and its development into dog types and dog breeds.
        The dog is a member of the genus Canis, which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and was the first species and the only large carnivore to have been domesticated.

        Genetic studies comparing dogs with modern wolves show reciprocal monophyly (separate groups), which implies that dogs are not genetically close to any living wolf and that their wild ancestor is extinct.
        An extinct Late Pleistocene wolf may have been the dog's ancestor,with the dog's similarity to the extant grey wolf being the result of genetic admixture between the two.
        In 2020, a literature review of canid domestication stated that modern dogs were not descended from the same Canis lineage as modern wolves, and proposes that dogs may be descended from a Pleistocene wolf closer in size to a village dog.
